3. Calculate the hashpower of your PC and estimate how long it would take to find a block in the present bitcoin networkLinks to an external site.

First i will calculate the hashpower of my computer. I use a 2020 M1 Macbook air, which has a hashpower of 606,195 hashes per second

The hashpower was calculated by running a simple test where the script continuously generated hashes for a fixed duration (in this case, 10 seconds). 
The number of hashes produced in that time was then divided by the elapsed time to determine the hash rate (hashes per second).

Steps to Calculate Hashpower:
Duration of Test: The test was set to run for 10 seconds.
Hash Function: The SHA-256 hashing function was applied repeatedly on the same data (simulating mining).
Counting Hashes: A counter (nonce) was incremented for each hash operation.
Calculate Hashpower: After the test period, the total number of hashes was divided by the elapsed time to determine the number of hashes per second (hashpower).

Script to calculate hashpower:
import time
import hashlib

def hash_block(data, nonce):
    """Hashes the block with the nonce using SHA-256."""
    block_data = str(data) + str(nonce)
    return hashlib.sha256(block_data.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

def calculate_hashpower(test_duration=10):
    """Calculate how many hashes per second (hashpower) the system can perform."""
    nonce = 0
    start_time = time.time()
    end_time = start_time + test_duration
    data = "Hashpower Test"
    
    while time.time() < end_time:
        hash_block(data, nonce)
        nonce += 1
    
    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
    return nonce / elapsed_time  # Hashes per second

# Calculate the hashpower over a 10-second period
hashpower = calculate_hashpower()

The output was - 606,195 hashes per second

To estimate how long it would take for my pc to find a block in the current Bitcoin network, we can use the current average hashrate of the Bitcoin network, 
which is 629.87 exahashes per second (Eh/s), and compare it to my PC's hashpower of approximately 606,195 hashes per second (H/s).

PC hashpower: 606,195 H/s
Bitcoin network hashrate: 629.87 Eh/s = 629.87 × 10¹⁸ H/s
Bitcoin's block time: Every 10 minutes (600 seconds), one block is found.

Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. Proportion of hashpower relative to the network:

Proportion =  Hashpower / Bitcoin network hashrate = 606,195 /629.87×10^18

2. Estimate the time to find a block: Since one block is found every 600 seconds by the whole network, 
the time for my PC to find a block is inversely proportional to my hashpower relative to the network.

Time to find a block = 600 seconds/Proportion

It would take approximately 19.76 billion years for my 2020 M1 MacBook Air to find a single block in the current Bitcoin network, 
given the current network hashrate of 629.87 exahashes per second and my MacBook's hashpower of 606,195 hashes per second.
